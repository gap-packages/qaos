Installing this package
=======================

This latest version of this package is available at 

      http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/download/gap/qaos.tar.bz2

or fetch it via FTP at

      ftp://ftp.math.tu-berlin.de/pub/algebra/Kant/contrib/gap/


There are two ways of installing the package.  If you have permission
to add files to the installation of GAP 4 on your system you may
install the qaos-gap package into the pkg/ subdirectory of the GAP
installation tree.

--  Installation in the GAP 4 pkg subdirectory on a Unix system.

    We assume that the archive file qaos-gap.tar.bz2 or qaos-gap.tar is
    present in pkg and that the current directory is pkg.  All that needs
    to be done is to unpack the archive.

    bash> tar xjf qaos.tar.bz2       # for the gzipped tar-archive
    bash> gap4
    [... startup messages ...]
    gap> LoadPackage("qaos");
    true
    gap>     

--  Installation in a private directory

    We assume that we are in a directory called  <mygap>  which also
    contains the archive file of the package.

    bash> mkdir pkg
    bash> cd pkg/
    bash> tar xjf ../qaos.tar.bz2

    When you start GAP 4 you have to use the option -l in the
    following manner:

    gap4 -l ";<mygap>"

    Note the semicolon!  It is imortant to have it there.  The effect
    is that the directory <mygap> is appended to the list of
    directories which GAP searches for input data.  Note that you do
    not say <mygap>/pkg.
