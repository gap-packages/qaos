  [33X[0;0Y[5XQaoS[105X serves as gateway within [5XGAP[105X to the [5XQaoS[105X databases of Algebraic Objects
  in  Berlin.  The  database  frontend  is  able  to output internal data in a
  [5XGAP[105X-conform  format.  This  [5XGAP[105X  package  both  triggers  the  database  and
  retrieves  the  data.  Beyond  that, it is also able to retransform received
  information into [5XGAP[105X objects which then could be used in the `normal way'.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XQaoS[105X  itself  is  a backend/frontend combination of an SQL database which is
  designed  to  grant public anonymous access via HTTP for reading operations,
  and restricted access via HTTP and TCP/IP for writing operations.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  package  functionality  is  partly driven by external utilities. At the
  moment  we  support  cURL only. cURL is used for network communication, HTTP
  GET and POST requests and reading results from the network socket, while the
  [5XGAP[105X part is used for content dependent operations.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YData for Transitive Groups has been taken from the current [5XGAP[105X distribution.
  We  like  to  thank  Alexander Hulpke for his permission to offer transitive
  group data in our databases.[133X
